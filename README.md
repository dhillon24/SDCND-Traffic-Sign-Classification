# SDCND-Traffic-Sign-Classification

## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

Overview
---
In this project, we will use convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. We will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, we will then try out your model on images of German traffic signs that we can find on the web.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dependencies

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

* [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset
